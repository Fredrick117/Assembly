# Assembly
Assembly is a game about designing starships for a variety of clientele. Whip up a design for Whitebeard and his crew so that they can hold up merchant ships, or help Admiral Hood introduce a new line of corvettes for his fleet.

## Customer requests
Before you start making your own starship, it's important to take a quick look at what the customer is requesting from you. They're paying you, after all!

Requests have two parts:
1. An unspoken assumption that the design you send to them is space-worthy. If it doesn't have a reactor to power the ship and thrusters to move it, they don't want it!
2. The request itself. This can include specifics like minimum/maximum speed, mininmum/maximum armor rating, the ability to be flown autonomously, armor rating, etc.

*A sample request, showing that John from Earth wants a destroyer and is willing to pay 43,750 credits for it.*

The customer won't pay you for your hard work if you mess it up, so make sure you do it right!

## Ship classifications
Designing a ship involves selecting its classification. This classification decides how large the starship is and how many subsystems it can hold. Currently, there are 5 classes of ships you can design:
- Escort
- Corvette
- Destroyer
- Cruiser
- Carrier

## Subsystems
Each ship type can hold a certain number of 'subsystems'. Subsystems are modules that can be added to a ship to give it certain stats such as speed, shield strength, armor rating, mass, and so on. Subsystems are added to your design using a grid system, so you may have to get creative with how these subsystems are oriented if you start to run out of space.

## Submitting your design
Once you're satisfied with your design, you can press the submit button at the top. If your ship design is not space-worthy, you'll get _no_ reward, but if you correctly satisfy the customer's request, then you'll get a nice sum of credits!
